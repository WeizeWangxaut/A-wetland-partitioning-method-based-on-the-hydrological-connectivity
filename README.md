The water level fluctuations in the study area during different hydrological years were simulated using a hydrodynamic model, firstly. The IDs, coordinates, and daily water levels for all points are then output. The points inundated during the simulation period are selected, and characteristic values of water level variations are calculated for each point using Waterlevel_characteristic_values.py. Based on these characteristic values, clustering is performed using Clustering_analysis.py, and the results are spatially visualized in ArcGIS.
